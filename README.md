AFO - Natural resource and environment ontology

THe maintenance of AFO ontology has ended. 
A frozen version of AFO is available at http://www.yso.fi/onto/afo/
and its files are available at https://github.com/NatLibFi/Finto-data/tree/master/vocabularies/afo.

The eariler work and editorial group was described at https://www.kiwi.fi/display/AFO/

This repository site will be used for translations and extraction of Finnish terms for Agrovoc Thesaurus maintained by FAO at https://agrovoc.uniroma2.it/agrovoc/agrovoc/en/.

Any further development of this ontology is based on volunteer input by subject specialists. 
As there is no funding to support further placement at finto.fi we are studying possibilities to find another repository for this ontology.
Some options are e.g. 
- agroportal at http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/AFO  (has an out-dated version, 
- - documentation: https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/wiki
- Ecoportal at http://ecoportal.lifewatch.eu/ontologies

Please contact the owner if you have further questions or want to participate.
